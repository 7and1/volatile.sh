        <h1>&gt; FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS</h1>
        <p class="tagline">Everything you need to know about volatile.sh</p>
      </header>

      <h2>How secure is volatile.sh?</h2>
      <p>
        volatile.sh uses <strong>AES-256-GCM encryption</strong>, the same standard used by
        governments and militaries worldwide. Your secret is encrypted
        <strong>in your browser</strong> before it ever leaves your device. The decryption key is
        stored in the URL fragment (the part after <code>#</code>), which browsers never send to
        servers. This means we literally cannot read your secrets.
      </p>

      <h2>Can you see my secrets?</h2>
      <p><strong>No.</strong> Zero-knowledge means we have zero knowledge of your data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your secret is encrypted client-side using Web Crypto API</li>
        <li>The encryption key is in the URL fragment, never sent to our server</li>
        <li>We only store encrypted ciphertext, which is useless without the key</li>
        <li>Even if we were compelled by law, we could not decrypt your data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What happens if I lose the link?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Your secret is permanently lost.</strong> The link contains the decryption key. If
        you lose it, there is no recovery mechanism. This is intentional for security.
      </p>

      <h2>Why use this instead of email/Slack?</h2>
      <p>
        Email and chat platforms store your messages forever on their servers. They can be
        subpoenaed, breached, or mined for advertising. volatile.sh:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stores nothing permanently (ephemeral RAM-only storage)</li>
        <li>Destroys messages after reading (burn-after-reading)</li>
        <li>Requires no account or personal information</li>
        <li>Works with any recipient who has a web browser</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can I password-protect my secret?</h2>
      <p>
        The link itself acts as authentication. Anyone with the full link (including the fragment)
        can decrypt the secret. Treat the link like the secret itself. For additional security,
        share the link through a secure channel (encrypted messaging, in person, etc.).
      </p>

      <h2>What's the maximum secret size?</h2>
      <p>
        Approximately <strong>1MB of text</strong> after encryption. This is about 500,000 words or
        roughly the length of a short novel. For most use cases (API keys, passwords, confidential
        messages), this is more than sufficient.
      </p>

      <h2>Do you log anything?</h2>
      <p>We log minimal operational data only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rate limit counters (hashed IP addresses, stored in RAM only)</li>
        <li>Request metrics for capacity planning</li>
        <li><strong>We do not log:</strong> secret content, keys, or personal identifiers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is this open source?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! The source code is available on GitHub. You can review it, run your own instance, or
        contribute. Transparency is essential for security tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I self-host this?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. volatile.sh is built on Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects, which you can deploy to
        your own Cloudflare account. See the
        <a href="/docs.html">documentation</a>
        for setup instructions.
      </p>

      <h2>What if volatile.sh shuts down?</h2>
      <p>
        All secrets have a maximum TTL of 7 days. Even if the service shut down immediately, any
        unread secrets would simply expire and be deleted. Your secrets are not dependent on our
        long-term existence.
      </p>

      <h2>How are secrets deleted?</h2>
      <p>
        Secrets are stored in Cloudflare Durable Objects with an automatic expiration alarm. When a
        secret is read, it is immediately deleted from the DO storage. Unread secrets are
        automatically deleted when their TTL expires. This is enforced at the platform level and
        cannot be bypassed.
      </p>

      <h2>Is the decryption key really never sent to the server?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. This is a fundamental property of how URLs work. The fragment (everything after the
        <code>#</code>) is <strong>never included in HTTP requests</strong>. You can verify this
        yourself by opening your browser's developer tools and watching the network requests when
        creating or reading a secret—the fragment is nowhere to be found.
      </p>

      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Security Reminders:</strong></p>
        <p>• Anyone with the link can read the secret—share it securely</p>
        <p>• Browser extensions or screen recorders can capture your content</p>
        <p>• Link previews in chat apps may send the URL to their servers (use caution)</p>
